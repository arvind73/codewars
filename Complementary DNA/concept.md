Replace letters 'A'/'T' with 'T'/'A' and letters 'G'/'C' with 'C'/'G'.

Make a dictionary with  keys to replaced with the values, here a total of 4 keys.
Use list comprehension within a join method.

Next way is by using if else conditions to check if it contains those letters in the string and changing them.
